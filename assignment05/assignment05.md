# Assignment 5: Low Fidelity Prototype
Vanessa Phan | DH 110 | Spring 2022

### Project Summary
#### Purpose
Learning music can be an extremely rewarding experience. My purpose for this project is to refine the 8notes music learning website and make it more accessible for both novice and experts alike. The service provides a plethora of musical research but lacks functionality, ease of use, and simple aesthetic. My objective is to declutter the site and organize it in a way that connects the user directly to their music learning goals. Since the demographic of my study are middle aged learners who are often busy and on-the-goal, I plan on transforming the website into a mobile device app that allows users to access information without requiring a desktop/computer. 

In this stage of my user design process, I will be creating a low fidelity prototype of my app in order to visualize the structure of the platform. This will be built upon my previous user research which focuses on the needs of my targeted users. Afterwards, I will test my lo-fi prototype for user feedback and make changes accordingly. 

#### User Research and Usage Scenario
During my user research stage, I discovered that community is an important part of learning music. For most individuals, it is the primary way in which they stay motivated and excited to progress with each lesson. I also found that learning music tends to be overwhelming, especially for adult beginners. 

Throughout this process, I will be mainly referencing the user persona I created for this project. The first is a young aspiring musician in his mid-30s who wishes to connect with other musicians and learn from them. However, he doesn’t have much time to seek social connections with his full time job. He is somewhat tech savvy and already knows the fundamentals of guitar and wants the sites he uses to provide him exactly what he needs. In his scenario, he was looking for a way to connect with other users but was not sure how to do that in an online space. 

The second persona is a recently retired older middle-aged man who wants to pick up music as a side hobby since he now has more free time. He knows there are a lot of benefits to learning an instrument and wants the process to be fun and inviting instead of competitive and frustrating. He is not particularly tech savvy and has a difficult time finding good music resources for beginners. For his scenario, he is frustrated that there are no clear guides for beginners to learn online and finds relief when there is a service that provides him with a quiz to find out what he needs.

**With this in mind, I created low fidelity prototypes for two tasks:**.  
* Task 1: Create a new post on the forum.  
* Task 2: Create a lesson plan according to the user’s level of expertise.

## User Interaction
After creating the prototype, I got feedback from a user and asked them to walk though my design and describe their thought process.

## Reflection
Overall, I gained a lot of insight into creating prototypes by researching articles, learning to use new softwares, and thinking in terms of how a user would when they come across a website or an app. From my experience, I found that my tasks were too straightforward and there was not enough room to gain the amount of feedback that I desired. When I was creating the prototype, I also found the navigation bar at the bottom is not necessary to include when users entered certain parts of the site, such as when creating a new post. Knowing this, I may opt for a hamburger icon for users to navigate instead. From the user interaction interview, I learned that my user was confused about certain parts of the task and not sure about what it was trying to accomplish. In later iterations of my prototype, I will be sure to add more information and directions so that the user is not left guessing about each of their actions.
