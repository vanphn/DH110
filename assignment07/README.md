# Assignment 7: High Fidelity Prototype
Vanessa Phan | DH 110 | Spring 2022

## Project Description
With this project, I aim to create a music learning platform capable of providing direct and accessible musical resources for beginners. Based on 8notes, an existing music resource website, my redesigned product will be optimized for mobile uses and make it more convenient for users to access information through devices that are more readily available to them. Additionally, the app will highlight the feature for musicians to connect with each other through discussions on the forum. 

#### Purpose and Process
In this stage of the design process, I created high-fidelity interactive prototypes for the purpose of learning from user feedback and refining the product to produce the best user experience. First, I analyzed the feedback from my low-fidelity prototype and made the necessary changes to then create a [design system](https://github.com/vanphn/DH110/tree/main/assignment06). I then created high fidelity prototypes of several proposed tasks that the product would support. These prototypes then go through several rounds of (1) testing (2) cognitive walkthrough (3) analyze the issues based on feedback (4) refining the design

## Interactive Prototype Tasks 
1, Create a new post on the discussion forum
> Users have the ability to connect with others by posting their thoughts and questions on the forum. This function can be easily identified through the navigation bar at the bottom. Currently, this feature allows for users to type in a topic, select a forum to post to, add additional tags, and add images and videos to the post. 
2. Sort music sheet by level of difficulty
> For music learners, it can be frustrating to sort through lots of materials to find one that is suitable for their skill level. While the app provides extensive resources, I also want to implement ways for users to apply filters and access what they need quickly.
3. Sign-Up and Onboarding (IN PROGRESS)
> Helps user get started and assess their skill level with a quiz. 

## Wireflow with Interface Design
#### Task 1: Create a new post on the discussion forum.

## Cognitive Walkthrough
The first round of cognitive walkthroughs were conducted during instructional time with other peers in the class. Though there was a lack of in-depth feedback due to the time constraint, I was still able to obtain a lot of useful information that stood out most to my participants. They noticed a lack of labels when creating a new post and stated that the header “New Post” is typically found at the top of the screen to quickly inform users. Overall, they seemed to be generally clear on the process of adding a new post to the forum. One participant added that they would like to see more functionality when creating a post such as adding pictures and videos.

They also expressed that the music sheet page was clear and easy to understand. The only comment I received was to separate the filters into different sections so that the filter for popularity is separate from the filter for difficulty and genre. This should help users feel less overwhelmed with all the options. 

Documentation for the in-class cognitive walkthrough can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LL3I2ozaDk84dL10F7L_bx0BGF84R31pbPOXQePJiLg/edit).

Given these feedback, I made the following changes to my design:
* added a label for the forum page to inform users when they are writing a new post
* added features for users to make changes to the body texts such as bold and italics
* allow for pictures and videos to be added with the post
* Separate the features of the filters into two separate sections with similar functionality

The final iteration of the design can be found on Figma through the link [here](https://www.figma.com/file/wgaCVEQk6uGymM53sOn3sB/DH110-A7?node-id=17%3A604).
