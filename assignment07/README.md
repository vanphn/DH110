# Assignment 7: High Fidelity Prototype
Vanessa Phan | DH 110 | Spring 2022

## Project Summary
With this project, I aim to create a music learning platform capable of providing direct and accessible musical resources for beginners. Instead of the original website which is currently not optimized for mobile uses, the redesigned product will be an app that will make it more convenient for users to access information through their smartphones. Additionally, the app will highlight the feature for musicians to connect with each other through discussions on the forum. In this stage of the design process, I created high-fidelity interactive prototypes for the purpose of learning from user feedback and refining the product to produce the best user experience. This process consisted of: (1) Create prototypes of certain tasks (2) testing the prototypes (3) analyze the issues based on feedback from cognitive walkthroughs (4) refining the product.

## Wireflow with Interface Design
#### Task 1: Create a new post on the discussion forum.
* One of the main features I want to highlight with this app is the ability for users to connect with one another by asking questions and posting their thoughts on the forum. Users can easily identify this function through the navigation bar at the bottom. They should then be able to type in a topic, select the forum to post to, and add additional tags.

#### Task 2: Sort music sheet by level of difficulty
* For music learners, it can be frustrating to sort through materials to find one suitable for their skills level. The goal of the app is to provide earning resources such as sheet music while also implementing a way for users to quickly access what they need.

## Cognitive Walkthrough
The first round of cognitive walkthroughs were conducted during instructional time with other peers in the class. Though there was a lack of in-depth feedback due to the time constraint, I was still able to obtain a lot of useful information that stood out most to my participants. They noticed a lack of labels when creating a new post and stated that the header “New Post” is typically found at the top of the screen to quickly inform users. Overall, they seemed to be generally clear on the process of adding a new post to the forum. One participant added that they would like to see more functionality when creating a post such as adding pictures and videos.

They also expressed that the music sheet page was clear and easy to understand. The only comment I received was to separate the filters into different sections so that the filter for popularity is separate from the filter for difficulty and genre. This should help users feel less overwhelmed with all the options. 

Documentation for the in-class cognitive walkthrough can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LL3I2ozaDk84dL10F7L_bx0BGF84R31pbPOXQePJiLg/edit).

Given these feedback, I made the following changes to my design:
* added a label for the forum page to inform users when they are writing a new post
* added features for users to make changes to the body texts such as bold and italics
* allow for pictures and videos to be added with the post
* Separate the features of the filters into two separate sections with similar functionality
