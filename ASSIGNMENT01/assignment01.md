### Severity Ratings in Heuristic Evaluation - [Nielson Norman Group](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/how-to-rate-the-severity-of-usability-problems/)  
1 = Cosmetic problem only: need not be fixed unless extra time is available on project 
2 = Minor usability problem: fixing this should be given low priority  
3 = Major usability problem: important to fix, so should be given high priority
 
### Website 1: [Teoria](https://www.teoria.com/)
Teori is an educational site that is meant to provide lessons and practice with music theory. Users can browse through different sets of tutorials such as reading music and learning about intervals and scales. The site also allows users to modify the setting to create exercises that are most suitable for them and their learning. Lastly, there is a reference page to help quickly define musical terms.

#### 1. Visibility of System Status
* With each lesson, the website does not inform users of how much their progression. While each part of the lesson is immediately shown to the users, once they begin, there is no appropriate feedback as to how many lessons remain. This may cause cognitive fatigue and force users to return to the index page to check how many they need to complete. (2)

> Recommendation: Have the index to the side of the lesson and highlight when a lesson is completed or have a progress bar to show completion
 
#### 2. Match Between System and the Real World
* Unlike other blog posts that contain helpful resources such as articles, the layout of Teori’s article page does not make it appealing to users to search through and read. In addition, the layout of the “latest publication” banner does not match other banners or displayed in a way that draws the user’s attention to it.(1)
Recommendation:  Redesign the layout of the articles in a way that is more interactive and prompts user to pay attention to the latest released articles

#### 3. User Control and Freedom
* If users were to make a mistake on the exercises, the option to restart or end appears at the top, but is not made obvious since the button looks the same as other buttons such as the answer choices.(2)
> Recommendation: differentiate these options from the rest by color coding these options should users ever find themselves in an unwanted state and would like to pause or exit. 
(T3a)
*Users have the option to toggle between the English and Spanish version of the site, but this choice is not clearly marked (the site only displays the word English or Espanol in plain text). (2)
Recommendation: Have the language option clearly displayed perhaps in its own box and lets users know they have the option to change the language with a toggle setting. 
#### 4. Consistency and Standards
*Most other sites have the search option in the navigation bar near the other menu option, but the option to search is hidden at the bottom of the page in very small fonts. This makes it difficult to search for information quickly since the tool can easily be overlooked by the user. 
Recommendation: Move the search bar to the top of the page by the navigation tab where it is often found. Change the appearance in a way that prompts users to enter a search query.
(T4a)
#### 5. Error Prevention 
*For each lesson, the button for the index is in between the buttons that lets users move from the previous and next part of the lesson. Since this option moves once users begin a lesson and the buttons are close to each other, users may accidentally trigger the index button, causing them to lose their place and restart their progress, which isn’t saved by the website. 
Recommendation: keep the option to progress through the lessons consistent throughout. 
#### 6. Recognition Rather Than Recall
*The search system is powered by Google and does not suggest possible topics that could be useful. 
Recommendation: provide some useful topics for users to click on once they press on the search bar. 
#### 7. Flexibility and Efficiency of Use
*For each of the exercises, the setting to customize practice exercises are loaded and hard to follow, especially for beginning music theory learners. Furthermore, these settings are displayed in an unorganized manner on the page, which can be jarring for users and makes it easy for them to overlook something important.
Recommendation: create a more friendly layout that is not daunting for beginners to use. 
#### 8. Aesthetic and Minimalist Design
*While the design of the page is minimalistic for the most part, certain elements of the footer are excessive and do not need to be displayed on every page. Since they will not provide necessary information while users are going through the tutorials or doing practices, irrelevant information should be removed from the pages.
Recommendation: clean and remove the footer elements from every page and only include where it is relevant such as the home page.

#### 9. Help Users Recognize, Diagnose, and Recover From Errors
For certain exercises, there is minimal feedback each time the user answers a question 
For the exercises, does not show show if the answer they click is wrong, only if it is correct
#### 10. Help and Documentation
*There are minimal instructions for completing the exercises. Additional information is provided when the user presses on the blue question mark icon next to the name of the exercise. However this icon is small and hard to spot. In addition, the help guide opens up in a new page with an overwhelming amount of information
Recommendation: Instead of navigating the user to a different page, create a banner each time the user hover over the help icon. 
 
### Website 1: [8notes](https://www.8notes.com/)
8Notes is a music training and lessons service that is run and owned by Red Balloon Technology Ltd. While mainly focused on providing free sheet music to novice and experts alike, they also provide a wide variety of resources on their site, including lessons, practice exercises, and play along tracks. The flexibility and free aspect of the site makes it a great choice for middle aged adults to find resources and learn music on their own time. 
 
#### 1. Visibility of System Status
* While navigating through the various lessons on the website, there is no progress bar or indications to help users identify how much they have completed. While the user can continue scrolling to view the index of lessons below, it is awkwardly displayed and takes up a large amount of unnecessary space on the screen. 
> Recommendation: Implicate a way to show progression for the user. This could mean moving the index to the side of the lesson to show users which lessons have been completed. Additionally, adding a progress bar at the top of the page could give users a better sense of understanding and control

#### 3. User Control and Freedom
* If users were to click on any part of the lesson, they only have the choice to continue from the lesson that they selected, and not anything prior. The only choice for viewing the previous lesson is to go back to the index page and manually select it. This can be a very frustrating experience while navigating through the lessons
> Recommendation: allow users to move back and forth freely without being constrained to only moving forward with the lesson they chose.

* The design of the page is meant to be fun and inviting by including bright colors for the web’s theme. However, this creates a very cluttered appearance and overload the user with too much visual sensory detail.
