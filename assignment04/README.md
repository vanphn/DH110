### Purpose of UX Storytelling
When designing a website, storytelling is crucial in understanding the user’s need and value so that these factors can be taken into consideration during the design process. By putting yourself into the shoes of another individual, the researcher is able to better empathize with the potential struggles of a demographic which could clarify difficult concepts and help generate new ideas. Since the scope of this project is music and learning, storytelling is a great tool for me to engage in the behavior, perspective, and attitude of the average user.

### Scenario and Journey Map
> Task 1: create a forum page to help users reach out to other musicians/learners and have a sense of community. 

Scenario: 

Elliot is an aspiring musician. He currently has a day job but is passionate about singing and wants to hone his musical talent by learning the guitar. He has a lot of questions, both about learning an instrument and about others going through the same journey as him. He also wants to build a sense of community to make learning more fun and exciting. Due to the pandemic and safety restrictions, he is unable to go to pubs or open mics to connect with people face to face. He decided to turn to the internet to find like-minded people but realized that other forums like Reddit are too big and doesn’t give him the sense of connection that he needsAfter researching on the internet, he stumbles upon *this app/website* and found that they offer lessons, resources, and music sheets for many different instruments but also have a forum page where members can ask questions and leave advice for other learners and musicians. Since there are many sub categories, he is surprised to know that this site seems to offer different communities depending on your interest, such as guitar or general advice about music

Since he is not a user, when he tries to create a post, the site prompts him to create an account, which asks for his basic information and presents a quiz (see Roy’s scenario) to determine his music experience levels and create programs that could be useful for him. After creating the account, he is redirected back to the forum page where he browses through the list of available forums. Since he is interested in learning guitar at the moment, he clicks on the tab for guitar, which then directs him to several sub-forums such as general guitar forum, guitar techniques, guitar community, etc. As he scrolled through the existing forums, he found that there are many posts that address his exact concerns when he was learning guitar. He was able to answer questions from other people that he also had when he was a beginner. He is delighted to find a community forum where he can go to ask questions and get feedback from other musicians
