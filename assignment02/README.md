# Assignment 2: Usability Testing
Vanessa Phan | DH 110 | Spring 2022

## Introduction
8Notes is a music training and lessons service that is run and owned by Red Balloon Technology Ltd. While mainly focused on providing free sheet music to novice and experts alike, they also provide a wide variety of resources on their site, including lessons, practice exercises, and play-along tracks. The flexibility and free aspect of the site makes it a great choice for middle aged adults to find resources and learn music on their own time. This website will be the source of my usability testing for this assignment. 
 
## Purpose
Through usability testing, I can gain a better understanding of the website and how users interact with the content and layout. Since most users often have a goal in mind when visiting a website, it is important to understand how easily and effectively they can navigate through their desired tasks. After gaining feedback from the participant, I can then identify possible usability issues by drawing from the heuristic analysis and make necessary changes based on the results. 
 
## Methodology
This usability test will be conducted remotely over Zoom where users will complete a series of pre-designed tasks in their own environment. I will be moderating in a quiet space while aiming for no distractions and interruptions. Due to the nature of the remote testing, I do not have complete control over my participant’s space, I try to ensure that their environment is also suitable for the testing period. We will both be using Mac devices during the testing.

As the moderator, I will begin by presenting the participant with a pre-test questionnaire which will assess their familiarity and impressions of the website. Once completed, we will move onto the testing portion where the participant will complete a series of tasks based on a likely scenario that users would encounter. During this process, the participant will be asked to talk aloud to document their thought process while I will provide guidance only when necessary. After the participant has progressed through all the tasks, a post-test questionnaire will be measuring the user’s experience such as difficulty and timeliness. The System Usability Scale will evaluate usability of the site by following the metrics of effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction. The Product Satisfaction Cards will help gauge how happy the user feels after their experience. Finally, demographic information will be collected last to eliminate response bias.

## Reflection
Through the pilot UT test, I was able to learn a lot about being a moderator and get a feel for the type of professionalism that is required during the task. I found that I was still nervous when conducting this study even though I knew the participant was someone that I knew on a personal level. This means that during future pilot UT, I will need to be more prepared to interact with other individuals. The UT session went much better than I originally thought and my participant was able to complete the tasks faster than I anticipated. This could be due to the technology proficiency of my user, who is younger than the demographic that this project is focused on. I also noticed that my tasks were designed to be solved linearly and without the help of the search bar. I realized during the test that sometimes tasks will overlap with each other, in that answers to the second task will be something that the participant has already discovered in the first task.

My takeaway from this pilot UT is that in general, my website is mostly easy to use and that the use of the search bar is a very useful feature for sites to have. I would focus more on being less nervous by being more prepared during the next pilot UT task. Additionally, I would try to make sure that the tasks are different enough from each other so that they do not overlap.
