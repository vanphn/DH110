# Assignment 1: Heuristic Evaluation of Music Learning Resources
Vanessa Phan | DH 110 | Spring 2022
 
## About the project:
For adults, learning a new skill can often be a daunting and difficult process. While research reveals that learning to play music can have many health and lifestyle benefits such as improved memory and muscle coordination, this endeavor is often ill-designed for adults since most music teaching institutions are often catered towards children. Luckily, the availability of the internet as an online learning resource is increasingly becoming more popular by providing a more flexible educational experience. Due to the constraints of everyday life such as work or familial responsibility, picking up an instrument and learning about music will most likely be something that adults accomplish in their free time. This project focuses on investigating, understanding, and implementing new designs to create a more pleasant user experience while keeping in mind the targeted demographic of middle-aged men interested in learning music.
 
### Severity Ratings in Heuristic Evaluation - [Nielson Norman Group](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/how-to-rate-the-severity-of-usability-problems/)  
1 = Cosmetic problem only: need not be fixed unless extra time is available on project.   
2 = Minor usability problem: fixing this should be given low priority.   
3 = Major usability problem: important to fix, so should be given high priority.    
* Severity ratings will be indicated at the end of each heuristics and placed in parentheses
 
### Website 1: [Teoria](https://www.teoria.com/)
Teori is an educational site that provides lessons and practice for those interested in music theory. Users can browse through different sets of tutorials such as reading music and learning about intervals and scales. The site also allows learners to modify the settings of each practice lesson to create exercises that are most suitable for them. Lastly, there is a reference page to help quickly define musical terms and specific articles that are updated regularly.
 
#### 1. Visibility of System Status
* During each lesson, the website does not inform users of their progress. While each part of the lesson is immediately shown to the users, once they begin, there are no appropriate feedback as to how many lessons remain. This may cause cognitive fatigue if the lessons are too long and force users to return to the index page to check the remaining lessons that they need to complete. (2)

> Recommendation: Have the index to the side of the lesson and highlight when a section is completed or have a progress bar to show completion. 
 
#### 2. Match Between System and the Real World
* Unlike other blog posts that contain helpful resources like articles, the layout of Teori’s articles page is not appealing for users to search through and read. In addition, the “latest publication” is displayed in a way that is not easily recognizable or immediately clear. (2)
<img width="700" alt="T2a" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63387277/164124369-d70c9346-b29c-4814-bc64-570c258c73b6.png">
> Recommendation: Redesign the layout of the articles in a way that is more interactive and prompts users to pay attention to the latest released articles.
 
#### 3. User Control and Freedom
* If users were to make a mistake on the exercises, the option to restart or end appears at the top, but is not made obvious since the button looks the same as other buttons such as the answer choices. (2)
<img width="700" alt="T3a" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63387277/164124383-f4ad17e2-c4c4-402d-bc93-8ee1b6524ae8.png">
> Recommendation: differentiate the option to restart and end from the rest by color coding them in different colors which makes it easier for users to to navigate out of an unwanted state. 
 
* Users have the option to toggle between the English and Spanish version of the site, but this choice is not clearly marked (the site only displays the word English or Espanol in plain text). Users may not recognize that they have the ability to change the language since there is nothing that prompts them to do so. (2)
> Recommendation: Have the language option clearly displayed perhaps in its own box and lets users know they have the option to change the language with a toggle symbol.
 
#### 4. Consistency and Standards
* Most sites have the search option in the navigation bar near other menu option, but on Teori, this function is hidden at the bottom of the page in very small fonts. This makes it difficult to search for information quickly since the tool is placed in an unconventional place and can easily be overlooked by the user. (4)
<img width="700" alt="T4a" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63387277/164124389-46dd8c50-b7db-47ec-a854-675a3b4c2f16.png">
> Recommendation: Move the search bar to the top of the page by the navigation tab where it is often found. Change the appearance in a way that prompts users to enter a search query.
 
#### 5. Error Prevention 
* For each lesson, the button for the index is in between the buttons that lets users move from the previous and next part of the lesson. Since this option moves once users begin a lesson and the buttons are close to each other, users may accidentally trigger the index button, causing them to lose their place and restart their progress, which isn’t saved by the website. (3)
> Recommendation: keep the option to progress through the lessons consistent throughout and move the index button to another obvious location
 
#### 6. Recognition Rather Than Recall
* Since this is a music learning website, users are encouraged to actively retain and remember information. However, since each lessons are dense with information and interconnected terms, users can easily forget important lessons and would have to traverse to the index or reference for review. (1)
> Recommendation: to make learning easier, provide hyperlinks for important terms or lessons to make learning more efficient. 
 
#### 7. Flexibility and Efficiency of Use
* For each of the exercises, the setting to customize practice exercises are loaded and hard to follow, especially for beginning music theory learners. Furthermore, these settings are displayed in an unorganized manner on the page, which can be jarring for users and makes it more likely for them to overlook something important. (2)
<img width="700" alt="T7a" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63387277/164124393-4e8a3acb-8222-421f-9b75-ddd33eab1a3a.png">
> Recommendation: create a more friendly and organized layout that is not daunting for beginners to use. 
 
#### 8. Aesthetic and Minimalist Design
* While the design of the page is minimalistic for the most part, certain elements of the footer are excessive and do not need to be displayed on every page. Since they will not provide necessary information while users are going through the tutorials or doing practices, irrelevant information should be removed from the pages. (2)
<img width="700" alt="T8a" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63387277/164124401-2a1b2ae4-0e62-459e-b738-226b6611018d.png">
> Recommendation: clean and remove the footer elements from every page and only include where it is relevant such as the home page. 
 
#### 9. Help Users Recognize, Diagnose, and Recover From Errors
* With each exercise, the user gets different type of feedback depending on the practice that they choose. However, feedback for certain lessons are not easily recognizable and displayed in a way that lets users instantly receive feedback. For example, for the ear training exercise, the wrong answer and correct answer are displayed in the same font and color, which may be more difficult to distinguish. 
> Recommendation: Make it obvious for the learner to know when they have entered a wrong/right response by changing the font to red/green. Include a explanation for the wrong answer for learners to quickly diagnose their mistake and learn through each wrong answer. 
 
#### 10. Help and Documentation
* There are minimal instructions for completing the exercises. Additional information is provided when the user presses on the blue question mark icon next to the name of the exercise. However this icon is small and hard to spot. In addition, the help guide opens up in a new page with an overwhelming amount of information. (3)
<img width="700" alt="T9a" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63387277/164124404-b4074002-6bb8-42b4-b585-e4e615496c36.png">
> Recommendation: Instead of navigating the user to a different page, create a banner with only necessary information each time the user hover over the help icon.
