# Assignment 1: Heuristic Evaluation of Music Learning Resources
Vanessa Phan | DH 110 | Spring 2022
 
## About the project:
For adults, learning a new skill can often be a daunting and difficult process. While research reveals that learning to play music can have many health and lifestyle benefits such as improved memory and muscle coordination, this endeavor is often ill-designed for adults since most music teaching institutions are often catered towards children. Luckily, the availability of the internet as an online learning resource is increasingly becoming more popular by providing a more flexible educational experience. Due to the constraints of everyday life such as work or familial responsibility, picking up an instrument and learning about music will most likely be something that adults accomplish in their free time. This project focuses on investigating, understanding, and implementing new designs to create a more pleasant user experience while keeping in mind the targeted demographic of middle-aged men interested in learning music.
 
### Severity Ratings in Heuristic Evaluation - [Nielson Norman Group](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/how-to-rate-the-severity-of-usability-problems/)  
1 = Cosmetic problem only: need not be fixed unless extra time is available on project.   
2 = Minor usability problem: fixing this should be given low priority.   
3 = Major usability problem: important to fix, so should be given high priority.    
* Severity ratings will be indicated at the end of each heuristics and placed in parentheses
 
### Website 1: [Teoria](https://www.teoria.com/)
Teori is an educational site that provides lessons and practice for those interested in music theory. Users can browse through different sets of tutorials such as reading music and learning about intervals and scales. The site also allows learners to modify the settings of each practice lesson to create exercises that are most suitable for them. Lastly, there is a reference page to help quickly define musical terms and specific articles that are updated regularly.
 
#### 1. Visibility of System Status
* During each lesson, the website does not inform users of their progress. While each part of the lesson is immediately shown to the users, once they begin, there are no appropriate feedback as to how many lessons remain. This may cause cognitive fatigue if the lessons are too long and force users to return to the index page to check the remaining lessons that they need to complete. (2)

<img width="700" alt="T1b" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63387277/164124357-8d558876-ae7b-426b-a881-4138350f37cb.png">
> Recommendation: Have the index to the side of the lesson and highlight when a section is completed or have a progress bar to show completion. 
 
#### 2. Match Between System and the Real World
* Unlike other blog posts that contain helpful resources like articles, the layout of Teori’s articles page is not appealing for users to search through and read. In addition, the “latest publication” is displayed in a way that is not easily recognizable or immediately clear. (2)
<img width="700" alt="T2a" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63387277/164124369-d70c9346-b29c-4814-bc64-570c258c73b6.png">
> Recommendation: Redesign the layout of the articles in a way that is more interactive and prompts users to pay attention to the latest released articles.
 
#### 3. User Control and Freedom
* If users were to make a mistake on the exercises, the option to restart or end appears at the top, but is not made obvious since the button looks the same as other buttons such as the answer choices. (2)
<img width="700" alt="T3a" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63387277/164124383-f4ad17e2-c4c4-402d-bc93-8ee1b6524ae8.png">
> Recommendation: differentiate the option to restart and end from the rest by color coding them in different colors which makes it easier for users to to navigate out of an unwanted state. 
 
* Users have the option to toggle between the English and Spanish version of the site, but this choice is not clearly marked (the site only displays the word English or Espanol in plain text). Users may not recognize that they have the ability to change the language since there is nothing that prompts them to do so. (2)
> Recommendation: Have the language option clearly displayed perhaps in its own box and lets users know they have the option to change the language with a toggle symbol.
 
#### 4. Consistency and Standards
* Most sites have the search option in the navigation bar near other menu option, but on Teori, this function is hidden at the bottom of the page in very small fonts. This makes it difficult to search for information quickly since the tool is placed in an unconventional place and can easily be overlooked by the user. (4)
<img width="700" alt="T4a" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63387277/164124389-46dd8c50-b7db-47ec-a854-675a3b4c2f16.png">
> Recommendation: Move the search bar to the top of the page by the navigation tab where it is often found. Change the appearance in a way that prompts users to enter a search query.
 
#### 5. Error Prevention 
* For each lesson, the button for the index is in between the buttons that lets users move from the previous and next part of the lesson. Since this option moves once users begin a lesson and the buttons are close to each other, users may accidentally trigger the index button, causing them to lose their place and restart their progress, which isn’t saved by the website. (3)
> Recommendation: keep the option to progress through the lessons consistent throughout and move the index button to another obvious location
 
#### 6. Recognition Rather Than Recall
* Since this is a music learning website, users are encouraged to actively retain and remember information. However, since each lessons are dense with information and interconnected terms, users can easily forget important lessons and would have to traverse to the index or reference for review. (1)
> Recommendation: to make learning easier, provide hyperlinks for important terms or lessons to make learning more efficient. 
 
#### 7. Flexibility and Efficiency of Use
* For each of the exercises, the setting to customize practice exercises are loaded and hard to follow, especially for beginning music theory learners. Furthermore, these settings are displayed in an unorganized manner on the page, which can be jarring for users and makes it more likely for them to overlook something important. (2)
<img width="700" alt="T7a" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63387277/164124393-4e8a3acb-8222-421f-9b75-ddd33eab1a3a.png">
> Recommendation: create a more friendly and organized layout that is not daunting for beginners to use. 
 
#### 8. Aesthetic and Minimalist Design
* While the design of the page is minimalistic for the most part, certain elements of the footer are excessive and do not need to be displayed on every page. Since they will not provide necessary information while users are going through the tutorials or doing practices, irrelevant information should be removed from the pages. (2)
<img width="700" alt="T8a" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63387277/164124401-2a1b2ae4-0e62-459e-b738-226b6611018d.png">
> Recommendation: clean and remove the footer elements from every page and only include where it is relevant such as the home page. 
 
#### 9. Help Users Recognize, Diagnose, and Recover From Errors
* With each exercise, the user gets different type of feedback depending on the practice that they choose. However, feedback for certain lessons are not easily recognizable and displayed in a way that lets users instantly receive feedback. For example, for the ear training exercise, the wrong answer and correct answer are displayed in the same font and color, which may be more difficult to distinguish. 
> Recommendation: Make it obvious for the learner to know when they have entered a wrong/right response by changing the font to red/green. Include a explanation for the wrong answer for learners to quickly diagnose their mistake and learn through each wrong answer. 
 
#### 10. Help and Documentation
* There are minimal instructions for completing the exercises. Additional information is provided when the user presses on the blue question mark icon next to the name of the exercise. However this icon is small and hard to spot. In addition, the help guide opens up in a new page with an overwhelming amount of information. (3)
<img width="700" alt="T9a" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63387277/164124404-b4074002-6bb8-42b4-b585-e4e615496c36.png">
> Recommendation: Instead of navigating the user to a different page, create a banner with only necessary information each time the user hover over the help icon. 

### Website 2: [8notes](https://www.8notes.com/)
8Notes is a music training and lessons service that is run and owned by Red Balloon Technology Ltd. While mainly focused on providing free sheet music to novice and experts alike, they also provide a wide variety of resources on their site, including lessons, practice exercises, and play along tracks. The flexibility and free aspect of the site makes it a great choice for middle aged adults to find resources and learn music on their own time. 
 
#### 1. Visibility of System Status
* While navigating through the various lessons on the website, there is no progress bar or indications to help users identify how much they have completed. While the user can continue scrolling to view the index of lessons below, it is awkwardly displayed and takes up a large amount of unnecessary space on the screen. (3) 
> Recommendation: Create a way to show progression for the user. This could mean moving the index to the side of the lesson to show users which lessons have been completed. Additionally, adding a progress bar at the top of the page could give users a better sense of understanding and control.
<img width="700" alt="N1a" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63387277/164296374-85b3e0c8-5766-45f5-9dad-2ab56659a880.png">
 
#### 2. Match Between System and the Real World
* While the site includes pictures of each instrument on the home page, this is missing for much of the resources. For example, the tuner function contains the same picture for six different instruments, forcing readers to scan through them instead of quickly recognizing using pictures and icons (2)
> Recommendation: add simple icons according each instruments so that users can quickly identify each sub pages. 
 
#### 3. User Control and Freedom
* If users were to click on any part of the lesson, they only have the choice to continue from the lesson that they selected, and not anything prior. The only choice for viewing the previous lesson is to go back to the index page and manually select it. This can be a very frustrating experience while navigating through the lessons. (3)
> Recommendation: allow users to move back and forth freely without being constrained to only moving forward with the lesson they chose. 
 
#### 4. Consistency and Standards
* Most other sites display the language option at the top of the page near the navigation bar where it is easily accessible. 8Notes have many different language options but they are located at the bottom of the page, which can be easily overlooked. (1)
> Recommendation: Move the language option to the top of the page with a toggle option to let users know what they can change the language
 
#### 5. Error Prevention 
* During the test training, there is no warning for when the next exercise begins after the user selects an answer. This may cause confusion and cause users to select the wrong answer by not knowing that the next test have begun. (2)
> Recommendation: prompt the user to press a button to begin the next test or have a countdown/indication for when the next assignment begins. 
 
#### 6. Recognition Rather Than Recall
* The website does a good job at including pictures for almost every genre and category along with the names so users quickly know what information they are receiving. The search option also auto fills with each key term and provides possible topics to click on.
 
#### 7. Flexibility and Efficiency of Use
* The site allows users to change the difficulty of the practices according to the proficiency of the user which can make learning a better experience overall. In addition, users can select the difficulty levels of the sheet music according to their levels of experience. The only factor that may be a hindrance is that the sorting option is hidden to the side which makes it harder for users to navigate to. (2) 
Recommendation: Declutter the main page that contains different categories of sheet music and make the option to categorize the types of sheet music more obvious and easy to configure
 
#### 8. Aesthetic and Minimalist Design
* The design of the page is bright, colorful, and includes many visual stimuli that helps users identify each musical instrument or theme. However, the website does have a cluttered appearance due to having too much information on each page. The lime green background coupled with an overload of images can create a create a jarring experienced that makes it harder to find information. (3)
> Recommendation: aim for a more minimalistic design and reduce each page to only the most important detail. Eliminate unnecessary images and/or replace them with icons
<img width="700" alt="N8a" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63387277/164296384-a4379b32-915b-450f-8cad-17fceb66862f.png">
 
#### 9. Help Users Recognize, Diagnose, and Recover From Errors
* For each training exercise, users do not receive feedback on the answer they chose and why that option is wrong. The correct answer is shown in very small text to the side of the page and the exercises begin without any action from the user. This may be frustrating as it does not give the learner enough time to process the information in order to improve. (3)
> Recommendation: Give the user feedback on the wrong answer they chose and provide the right answer as well. Provide more instructions at the start and end of each exercise. Wait until the user is ready (by having them click a button) before moving to the next exercise. 
<img width="700" alt="N9a" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63387277/164296396-11769244-59e5-470c-a5b0-1948def07d10.png">
 
#### 10. Help and Documentation
* Unlike Teori, 8notes is less focused on musical exercises and therefore does not have an extensive help guide. Since some of the exercises are similar, it will be helpful for the user to have more information about the training. (2)
* The help guide on the site’s footer only contains information on printing music, audio playback, and transposition and parts request. For the vast amount of information on the page, users would most likely navigate to the help page and would likely find that the information they need is located on the site tour. 
Recommendation: make the help guide more comprehensive for users. Perhaps include a frequently asked question page.
